With Polling our used energy was constant 3.3 mA. Pushing all the buttons will increase it by a small amount because of the internal pull ups, but it is insignificant. Only increased to 3.7

Switching to interrupts will increase the amount of current drawn to 5.7 mA. Pushing all the buttons will increase it to 6.2 mA.

Going using the sleep mode makes it go down to constant aproximately 1.8 uA. Each button pressed increases the current drawn by aproximately 80 uA.

using deep sleep mode (EM3), disabling ram blocks 1-3 we reduce the current to about 800 nA. It is hard to measure because it is fluctuating wildly between 400nA and 1.4 uA.
