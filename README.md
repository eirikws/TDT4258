# TDT4258
Repository for the exercises in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Design


The course was split into three parts:

Part one contains some basic assembler code. 

part two contains a fairly simple sound generator that can play a monotone song.

part three contains a uClinux application, the game snake, and a linux driver for the gamepad.
The intresting folders are ex3/local_src/driver-gamepad-1.0 and ex3/local_src/game-1.0.
